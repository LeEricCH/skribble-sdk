## What is Skribble SDK?

I have created this SDK to make it easier for you to get started with the Skribble API. I myself used the Skribble API in many projects and had to write the same code again and again. So I decided to create a SDK for the Skribble API.

<Note>
  Please note that this SDK is unofficial and not maintained by Skribble.
</Note>

## Features
The current version of the SDK includes the following features:

### **Python SDK**
The Python SDK comes with a fully built SDK that includes:

- Error handling
- Easy to use methods for the most common operations
- Pre-configured connection to the Skribble API
- IntelliSense support for the Skribble API
- Extended documentation with examples

### **Typescript SDK**
Coming soon.

## Tech stack

Skribble SDK is fully open-source built using the following technologies:

**Python**

- [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) - for data validation and settings management
- [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) - for making HTTP requests
- [Base64](https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html) - for encoding and decoding data
- [Typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) - for type hints

**Typescript**

- Coming soon.
