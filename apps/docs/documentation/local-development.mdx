## Introduction

Skribble SDK is set up in a monorepo (via [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)) and is fully open-source.
Here's the monorepo structure:

```
apps
├── docs
├── py-sdk
├── ts-sdk
packages
├── eslint-config
├── typescript-config
```

The `apps` directory contains the code for:

- `py-sdk`: The Python SDK
- `ts-sdk`: The Typescript SDK
- `docs`: The documentation site

The `packages` directory contains the code for:

- `eslint-config`: ESLint configurations for the codebase. Boilerplate code included as part of the [create Turbo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/getting-started/create-new) command
- `typescript-config`: TypeScript configurations for the codebase. Boilerplate code included as part of the [create Turbo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/getting-started/create-new) command

## Running the SDKs
### Step 1: Local setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repo">
    Clone the [Skribble SDK repo](https://github.com/TODO.git).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TODO.git app-name
    ```    

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">    
    Change to the root directory of the cloned repository and install the dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    cd app-name
    pnpm install
    ```      
  </Step>    

</Steps>



### Step 2: Configure Turbo remote caching (optional)
Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login via Turborepo CLI">
    From the project root, run the command:
    ```bash    
    npx turbo login
    ```
    This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache">
  Link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:
  ```bash
  npx turbo link
  ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Test the SDKs

```bash root
pnpm run test
```
